## 1. Description

This repository, `iso-14053-mfca-lib`, provides an innovative C#-developed library crafted to empower users in understanding and applying the principles of ISO 14053:2021(E). To enhance the accessibility of this intricate standard, I harnessed the versatility of Jupyter Notebook to create engaging, interactive documentation and dynamic code examples. This seamless fusion of theoretical insights and hands-on programming not only makes learning more enjoyable but also equips users with a thorough guide for effective implementation.

## 2. Background (ISO 14053 MFCA)

The primary goal of MFCA is to make the true cost of material and energy inefficiency visible. By assigning costs not just to final products but also to waste and emissions, it helps organizations identify significant opportunities for both financial savings and environmental improvement.

ISO 14053:2021 was developed to make MFCA more accessible, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Relation to Other Standards: The core framework for MFCA is defined in ISO 14051. However, implementing the full MFCA framework can be complex and resource-intensive.

A "Phased Approach": ISO 14053:2021 addresses this challenge by providing a practical, step-by-step, and flexible guide. It allows an organization to implement MFCA at its own pace, starting small (e.g., with a single process or department) and gradually expanding.
